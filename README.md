# Simple-Movie-Recommendation
This project builds a simple movie recommendation system that suggests similar movies based on the descriptive content of each film. The system uses a content-based filtering approach, comparing movie descriptions (overviews), genres, and keywords to measure the similarity between films. The machine learning model used is K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
